  <p>The Detroit Tigers are an American professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan. 
  The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) 
  Central division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1901. 
  They are the oldest continuous one-name, one-city franchise in the AL. The Tigers have won four World
