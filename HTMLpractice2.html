  <p>
  Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. 
  The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player 
  on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are 
  to hit the ball into the field of play, and to run the bases - having its runners advance 
  counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive 
  team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around 
  the bases.A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home 
  plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team who scores the most runs by the end 
  of the game is the winner.
