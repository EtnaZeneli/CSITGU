 <h1>Personal Experience</h1>
 <p>Being an international student and coming to Lamoni was a big difference. 
 One of the biggest differences I've experienced was the people and the enviorment.
 Lamoni is a very quite place and is not as liveley as the place that im used to, 
 everything closes extra early and there is a lack of local places to eat or do 
 activites. I would consider that to be one of the downfalls of Lamoni. Whereas 
 hering that you might think what's there good to do, well look around and you'll 
 see that Lamoni poeple are some of the most welcoming people I've met. The good in 
 Lamoni is that it makes you feel like you are at home even when you live an ocean away 
 from home. Eventhough Lamooni is a quite place it has it's amazing attributes that make it an amazing place. </p>
